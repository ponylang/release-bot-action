## Replace "step" input parameter with overriding of entrypoint

Previously, when configuring the release-bot, you would indicate which step should be run like:

```yml
        with:
          step: start-a-release
          git_user_name: "Ponylang Main Bot"
          git_user_email: "ponylang.main@gmail.com"
```

`step` as an input option has been removed and replaced by `entrypoint`. `entrypoint` is an existing option that GitHub actions supports for changing the script to run from within an action.

Previously, the steps where:

- start-a-release
- trigger-release-announcement
- announce-a-release

Those steps have been replaced with the following corresponding entrypoints:

- start-a-release.bash
- trigger-release-announcement.bash
- announce-a-release.bash

The aforementioned configuration from above would now be:

```yml
        with:
          entrypoint: start-a-release.bash
          git_user_name: "Ponylang Main Bot"
          git_user_email: "ponylang.main@gmail.com"
```
