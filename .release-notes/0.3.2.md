## Allow for overriding how trigger release announcement step gets version information

Adds an optional environment variable VERSION that can be set to an explicit value when using the trigger-release-announcement step instead of getting the version from GITHUB_REF.

The VERSION environment variable allows for a wider variety of ways to trigger the step. Prior to this change, the step would not work if it wasn't triggered by pushing a tag. With this change, you can now use it other workflows.

[ponyc](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc) will use it to be triggered once assets are uploaded to Cloudsmith doing something slightly more complicated than the following simplified example:


```yaml
name: Handle external events

on: repository_dispatch

jobs:
  trigger-release-announcement:
    if: |
      github.event.action == 'cloudsmith-package-synchronised' &&
      github.event.client_payload.data.repository == 'releases' &&
      github.event.client_payload.data.name == 'ponyc-x86-64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz'

    name: Trigger release announcement
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Trigger
        uses: ponylang/release-bot-action@0.3.2
        with:
          step: trigger-release-announcement
          git_user_name: "Ponylang Main Bot"
          git_user_email: "ponylang.main@gmail.com"
        env:
          RELEASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_TOKEN }}
          VERSION: ${{ github.event.client_payload.data.version }}
```
