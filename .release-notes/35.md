## Split "start-a-release" into multiple different commands

Previously, release-bot-action had a command `start-a-release` that did multiple things. It:

- Updated the version in `VERSION`
- It ran the `changelog-tool` `release` command to version `CHANGELOG.md`
- It updated the version in `corral.json` if `corral.json` existed

AND...

It kicked off the next stage of the release process by pushing back a new tag for the actual release itself like 1.0.0.

This was all well and good but as part of the release process, not all projects needs `corral.json` updated. Many projects don't have a `corral.json` to update. Others have other files they need updated as part of pre-release process. Our emacs mode for example have version information that needs to be updated in .el files in order to get [MELPA](https://melpa.org/) to pick up a new version.

Rather than shove more and more functionality into a single script, start-a-release has been broken apart into multiple commands that can be called from steps in a GitHub actions workflow to compose functionality together on a per-project basis.

Those new commands covered in detail in our updated `prepare-for-a-release` example in README.md. The new step commands are:

- triger-artifact-creation.bash
- update-changelog-for-release.bash
- update-version-corral-json.bash
- update-version-in-VERSION.bash

Other commands will be forthcoming.
