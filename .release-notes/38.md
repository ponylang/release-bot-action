## Add command to update the runner in action.yml files

The best way to run a released GitHub action is to use a prebuilt docker
image. This saves time with building the image and guarantees that each
run will be using exactly the same action code.

This is best accomplished by settings runs.image to the image in question
in action.yml.

However, this does have a drawback of not being able to use arbitrary commits
to run with as that commit will be grabbed BUT... the image in its action.yml
will be used. This is problematic for testing actions.

The two commands included in this commit address both issues.

### update-action-to-use-docker-image-to-run-action.py

Updates runs.image to a docker image with the version we are releasing.
As part of the release process for an action, it should then also make
sure to push a prebuilt image to DockerHub for the action in question.

This command should be run in the pre-tagging job.

### update-action-to-use-dockerfile-to-run-action.py

Switches back to using `Dockerfile` for how to run the action.

This command should be run in the post-tagging job.
