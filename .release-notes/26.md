## Add preartefact-changelog-check.bash command

The preartefact-changelog-check.bash command validates that the changelog contains an entry for `X.Y.Z` where `X.Y.Z` is the release that is underway.

The command can be used to protect against misconfiguration of workflows and more importantly, a user inadvertently pushing a `X.Y.Z` tag to start a release rather than the correct `release-X.Y.Z`.
