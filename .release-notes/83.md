## Handle release already existing when uploading release notes

Previously, the uploading of release notes assumed that the release didn't exist yet. If the release already existed, the release notes upload would fail.

Only working when a release didn't exist made sense for all our ponylang usage. However, for other projects that create assets as part of the build process and store them in GitHub releases rather than Cloudsmith, the release might already exist.

Now, we will check to see if the release exists. If it does, we update it with our release notes. If it doesn't, we will create the release like we previously did.
