## Switch supported actions/checkout from v1 to v2

We've switched from supporting `actions/checkout@v1` to `actions/checkout@v2`.

The are a few changes to configuration of release-bot that come along with this change. You should check out the examples in the README.md to see the latest on how to configure.

Highlights of changes:

- Use `actions/checkout@v2`
- `action/checkout` requires the setting `token` and `ref` values.
- Most workflows no longer require a release token being passed to the action, only to `actions/checkout`.
- Workflows no longer take a default branch. The default branch is now handled by `actions/checkout@v2`.
